 Initial Project

Build a desktop app that runs a cash register, handles inventory, and manages the entire store.
In order to allow it grow, we eill be creating a WebAPI layer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * We will build a MVP(Minimum Viable Product) that can be expanded to cover all of the features
   needed over time. The first step is getting all of the major pieces set up, including:
        #Git on Azure DevOps
        #SQL database(SSDT)
        #WebAPI with authentication
        #WPF application that can log into the API
